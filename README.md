BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

overview: 
I want to look at if/how marital status impacts survival across different genders and cancer  sites. I know in general epi literature, there is a tendency to see that marriage typically  is a stronger predictor of survival in men than in women depending on the disease.I plan to further stratify by race.

introduction:
It has been found across social epidemiological studies that marital status can be a predictor of survival outcomes for various diseases. Sometimes it is found that there is a  stronger association between being married and longer survival for men than for women. I  intend to investigate whether or not this pattern holds true for those diagnosed with various forms of cancer in the US and Puerto Rico, utilizing the SEER dataset. I would also like to further explore the effects of race on these potential associations. Epidemiology itself is an interdisciplinary field, and this project will also utilize the fields of social epidemiology, oncology, and biostatistics.

I am using the SEER database below (over 8 million observations so far, so I can't upload it):

Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program (www.seer.cancer.gov) SEER*Stat Database: Incidence - SEER 18 Regs Research Data + Hurricane Katrina Impacted Louisiana Cases, Nov 2018 Sub (1975-2016 varying) - Linked To County Attributes - Total U.S., 1969-2017 Counties,National Cancer Institute, DCCPS, Surveillance Research Program, released April 2019, based on the November 2018 submission.

results;

Overall, both female sex and being partnered are associated with prolonged survival in cancer patients with statistically significant p-values of less than 0.05 in all ANOVAs and t-tests performed. The one caveat to the statistical significance of these results is that survival is generally only prolongued by a matter of a few months; while this may be emotionally meaningful for the loved ones of cancer patients, I also think that this could also mean prolongued suffering for terminally ill patients. Further, although the cleaned dataset has ~1.7 million observations, it is possible that that means the dataset is overpowered to detect significance. There are a few exceptions to the above stated pattern when subsetting the dataset by cancer sites. Specifically, bone and articular cartiledge patients survive longer when partnered, however this tendency is not statistically significant and there is virtually no difference between sexes; skin cancer patients are statistically differentiated between groups, except for single males and partnered females; mesothial single males are not statistically differentiated from females, whether single or partnered; breast patients are significantly differentiated by sex but not by partnership status; partnered genital patients survive longer than single patients, however in this group men survive longer than women and these findings are statistically significant -- this pattern is also true for urinary tract patients; single male and female thyroid patients and ill-defined sites patients are not statistically differentiated.
